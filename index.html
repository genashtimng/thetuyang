            The bedrock of Borneo is its indigenous people and their connection
            and knowledge of the land as keepers, and also as innovators.

            The artistic elements by the various artists from different
            communities (indigenous and non-indigenous alike), and from Miri and
            wider Sarawak and Malaysia which carries the message of harmony -
            balancing human, their culture the natural environment - as well as
            the innovation (contemporary), hopes to evoke thought about how we
            can all always do better to achieve balance. Our curation carries
            the reminder that all of us co-exist and ideally, in balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            That nature and innovation can co-exist. That tradition and modern
            day life can co-exist.

          nspired by nature’s ecology, we are establishing the connection
          between People/Community (in this case, Shell employees) and the
          natural world around them in order to achieve Balance/Harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          By interpreting the art from the ground floor as the genesis from the
          earth/root/soil, to the top floors as the sun/sky/mountain top - it is
          telling a story of the layers of our ecology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth from the soil to the tallest trees or the air on the mountain
          top (and vice versa - where rain from the clouds fall back to the
          earth) is just as nature intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same way how Borneo indigenous communities gain
          inspiration in everything we do and create for hundreds of years.
