            The bedrock of Borneo is its indigenous people and their connection
            and knowledge of the land as keepers, and also as innovators.
          </p>
          <p>
            The artistic elements by the various artists from different
            communities (indigenous and non-indigenous alike), and from Miri and
            wider Sarawak and Malaysia which carries the message of harmony -
            balancing human, their culture the natural environment - as well as
            the innovation (contemporary), hopes to evoke thought about how we
            can all always do better to achieve balance. Our curation carries
            the reminder that all of us co-exist and ideally, in balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            That nature and innovation can co-exist. That tradition and modern
            day life can co-exist.

          nspired by nature’s ecology, we are establishing the connection
          between People/Community (in this case, Shell employees) and the
          natural world around them in order to achieve Balance/Harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          By interpreting the art from the ground floor as the genesis from the
          earth/root/soil, to the top floors as the sun/sky/mountain top - it is
          telling a story of the layers of our ecology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growth from the soil to the tallest trees or the air on the mountain
          top (and vice versa - where rain from the clouds fall back to the
          earth) is just as nature intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same way how Borneo indigenous communities gain
          inspiration in everything we do and create for hundreds of years.
